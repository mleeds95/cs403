\begin{abstract}
Ever since 2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto released the first workable blockchain-based application, Bitcoin, the technology has been an area of much interest, research, and development both in academia and the private sector. While Bitcoin uses cryptographically linked "blocks" of transactions to transfer money over the Internet, the decentralized consensus technology can be applied to a wide range of problems from censorship-resistant content hosting to autonomous organizations to self-enforcing smart contracts. However the frameworks necessary to build such apps with a minimal amount of work do not yet exist. Blocky seeks to fill this hole by providing a language that arbitrary blockchain applications can be written in.
